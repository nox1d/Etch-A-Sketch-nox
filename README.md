# Etch-A-Sketch

This is a project to build a browser version of an Etch-A-Sketch from The Odin Project.

Building this project will apply what I have learned about CSS flexbox, JavaScript DOM manipulation, and most importantly, Event Listeners.

## Upcoming features
- Darken effect (currently not working)
- Click to draw rather than hover
- Eraser button
- Pen cursor
- Better UI
- Paint Bucket??
